# Deployment Guide — Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend) + MongoDB Atlas (database)

This app is split into two deployable pieces:

- `backend/` → Node/Express API + Socket.io → deploy to **Render**
- `frontend/` → React static build → deploy to **Vercel**
- Database → **MongoDB Atlas** (free tier is fine to start)

---

## 1. MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a free account at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and create a free (M0) cluster.
2. Database Access → add a database user with a username/password.
3. Network Access → add `0.0.0.0/0` (allow access from anywhere) so Render can connect.
4. Database → Connect → "Drivers" → copy the connection string, it looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/srms_saas?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
   Replace `<username>` / `<password>` with the database user you created, and keep
   `srms_saas` (or any name you like) as the database name.

## 2. Backend on Render

You can use the included `render.yaml` blueprint, or set it up manually.

### Option A — Blueprint (recommended)
1. Push this project to a GitHub repo.
2. In Render: New → Blueprint → connect the repo → Render reads `render.yaml` automatically.
3. When prompted, fill in:
   - `MONGODB_URI` → your Atlas connection string from step 1
   - `FRONTEND_URL` → your Vercel URL (you can update this after step 3, once you have it)
   - `JWT_SECRET` is auto-generated for you

### Option B — Manual
1. New → Web Service → connect your repo.
2. **Root directory:** `backend`
3. **Build command:** `npm install`
4. **Start command:** `npm start`
5. Add environment variables (copy from `backend/.env.example`):
   - `MONGODB_URI`
   - `JWT_SECRET` (any long random string)
   - `FRONTEND_URL` (your Vercel domain, can update later)
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
6. Deploy. Once live, note your backend URL, e.g. `https://srms-backend.onrender.com`.
7. Confirm it's healthy by visiting `https://srms-backend.onrender.com/api/health`.

> Render's free tier spins down when idle — the first request after inactivity may take ~30s to wake up. Upgrade to a paid instance for always-on production use.

## 3. Frontend on Vercel

1. In Vercel: New Project → import the same GitHub repo.
2. **Root directory:** `frontend`
3. Framework preset: Create React App (Vercel usually auto-detects this).
4. Environment variable:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = your Render backend URL (e.g. `https://srms-backend.onrender.com`)
5. Deploy. The included `vercel.json` makes sure client-side routes (e.g. `/admin/dashboard`)
   don't 404 on refresh.
6. Once deployed, copy your Vercel URL (e.g. `https://srms.vercel.app`).

---

## 4. Connect the two

Go back to Render → your backend service → Environment → set `FRONTEND_URL` to your Vercel
URL (comma-separate multiple origins if you add a custom domain later, e.g.
`https://srms.vercel.app,https://app.yourdomain.com`). Redeploy the backend so the new CORS
setting takes effect.

---

## 5. Try it

1. Visit your Vercel URL → `/register` → create a restaurant account.
2. Log in, add menu items and tables, place a test order, generate a bill.
3. Each new restaurant that signs up gets its own isolated data automatically — no extra setup
   needed per customer.

---

## Custom domains

- **Vercel:** Project → Settings → Domains → add your domain, follow the DNS instructions.
- **Render:** Service → Settings → Custom Domains → add your API subdomain (e.g. `api.yourdomain.com`).
- Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` (Vercel) and `FRONTEND_URL` (Render) to match once domains are live.

## Selling this as a product

- `Restaurant.plan` and `Restaurant.active` in `backend/models/Restaurant.js` are there so you can
  wire up a billing provider (e.g. Stripe) and flip a restaurant to inactive if a subscription lapses —
  the `auth` middleware already blocks login for inactive restaurants.
- Because every query is scoped by `restaurantId`, you can safely onboard unlimited restaurants on
  one deployment without giving them access to each other's data.
